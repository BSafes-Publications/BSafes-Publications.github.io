## Appendix B: Additional Information about IC3 Data 
- Each complaint is reviewed by an IC3 analyst. The analyst categorizes the complaint according to the crime type(s) that are appropriate. Additionally, the analyst will adjust the loss amount if the complaint data does not support the loss amount reported.
- One complaint may have multiple crime types.
- Some complainants may have filed more than once, creating a possible duplicate complaint.
- All location-based reports are generated from information entered when known/provided by the complainant.
- Losses reported in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars when possible.
- Complaint counts represent the number of individual complaints received from each state and do not represent the number of individuals filing a complaint.
- Victim is identified as the individual filing a complaint.
- Subject is identified as the individual perpetrating the scam as reported by the victim.
- “Count by Subject per state” is the number of subjects per state, as reported by victims.
- “Subject earnings per Destination State” is the amount swindled by the subject, as reported by the victim, per state.
