The U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are issuing this advisory for the international community, the private sector, and the public to warn of attempts by Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK, a.k.a. North Korea) information technology (IT) workers to obtain employment while posing as non-North Korean nationals. There are reputational risks and the potential for legal consequences, including sanctions designation under U.S. and United Nations (UN) authorities, for individuals and entities engaged in or supporting DPRK IT worker-related activity and processing related financial transactions.

The DPRK dispatches thousands of highly skilled IT workers around the world to generate revenue that contributes to its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs, in violation of U.S. and UN sanctions. These IT workers take advantage of existing demands for specific IT skills, such as software and mobile application development, to obtain freelance employment contracts from clients around the world, including in North America, Europe, and East Asia. In many cases, DPRK IT workers represent themselves as U.S.-based and/or non-North Korean teleworkers.  The workers may further obfuscate their identities and/or location by sub-contracting work to nonNorth Koreans. Although DPRK IT workers normally engage in IT work distinct from malicious cyber activity, they have used the privileged access gained as contractors to enable the DPRK’s malicious cyber intrusions. Additionally, there are likely instances where workers are subjected to forced labor.

This advisory provides detailed information on how DPRK IT workers operate; red flag indicators for companies hiring freelance developers and for freelance and payment platforms to identify DPRK IT workers; and general mitigation measures for companies to better protect against inadvertently hiring or facilitating the operations of DPRK IT workers. An Annex provides additional information on DPRK IT workers from reports produced by the UN 1718 Sanctions Committee’s DPRK Panel of Experts. The FBI encourages U.S. companies to report suspicious activities, including any suspected DPRK IT worker activities, to local field offices.
